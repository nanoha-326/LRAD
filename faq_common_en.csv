question,answer
What kind of things are OK to put in?,"This device can process a wide variety of waste, including organic matter. Unlike regular waste disposal, detailed separation is not required. However, to increase the efficiency of disposal, simple pre-treatment may be recommended depending on the moisture content and size of the waste. It can process everyday organic waste from ordinary households and businesses, food waste with a moisture content (about 60%), livestock waste, and infectious waste (used diapers, gauze, dialyzers, etc.)."
Please tell me the procedure for inputting,"First, open the inlet and put the waste in. At this time, be sure to check that no inorganic matter has been mixed in. Once the waste has been put in, close the inlet, open the damper, and put the waste into the furnace. It is divided into left and right sides, so open and close each side at a time. If you want to check that the waste has been put into the furnace, close the damper completely and then open the inlet to check."
What is the principle of Far-Infrared Laser Decomposition (LRAD)?,"When ceramic powder spread on the bottom of the furnace is heated from below with a heater, far infrared rays are generated. When waste is put into the furnace, the far infrared rays from the ceramics cause the put-in material to undergo thermal decomposition (a chemical reaction that occurs when organic compounds are heated in a low-oxygen environment). Eventually, the organic matter (put-in material) is decomposed to the limit and becomes a highly pure inorganic powder."
What is the role of electrons (negative ions)?,"Electrons (negative ions) play a role in activating oxygen molecules and generating highly reactive active oxygen. This active oxygen promotes the pyrolysis reaction and enables efficient decomposition, which also has the effect of suppressing heat loss during the reaction. Therefore, the supply of electrons plays an important role in maintaining a stable pyrolysis process."
What can't you process?,"Inorganic materials (stones, glass, iron, metals, water, aluminum, etc.) In addition, never put in substances that may generate toxic gases (chlorine-based, fluorine-based, PCBs, etc.), radioactive materials, chemicals, spray cans, etc."
What kind of staff and skills are required to operate it?,"No special qualifications or advanced skills are required to operate the equipment. Basic operations are automated, and processing is possible simply by feeding the material to be processed in the specified procedure. Daily operations are simple, and no special technical measures are required. Furthermore, regular inspections and maintenance are carried out by specialized companies, so the operational burden is kept to a minimum."
How much can you process per day?,"A maximum of 3 cubic meters (m3) can be processed per day.
This is equivalent to about 66 household garbage bags (45 liters). However, because the bulk density (density) of the material being processed varies depending on the type of material, the actual processing volume and processing time may vary. Please consider this as a rough guide only."
What is a pyrolysis device?,"A pyrolysis device is a device that heats waste and other organic matter in an oxygen-less environment to chemically decompose (thermal decomposition). By processing at high temperatures, the processed material is transformed into combustible gases, charcoal, ceramic residues, etc. Unlike combustion, it does not involve direct oxidation (combustion), so it can efficiently reduce volume and recycle while suppressing the generation of harmful gases.
Pyrolysis is suitable for processing a variety of organic waste, such as waste plastic, woody biomass, sludge, waste paper, clothing, and diapers, and contributes to the conversion of waste into resources and energy (thermal recycling)."
What is pyrolysis?,"Pyrolysis is a process in which organic matter is heated in an oxygen-poor environment to chemically decompose it. This device uses ions (negative ions) and far infrared rays to promote pyrolysis. Ions activate oxygen and increase its reactivity, while far infrared rays efficiently transmit heat to the inside, achieving more effective decomposition."
